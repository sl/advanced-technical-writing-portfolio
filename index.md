## List of Works

### [A Discursive Analysis of Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](discursive-analysis.md)

Many programming tutorials exist on the internet today, but *Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby* stands out as unique among them. It woos its readers not with a promise of practical knowledge, but with the beauty that Why The Lucky Stiff (the famous ruby programmer) himself sees in programming, and Ruby. I take a look into what makes *Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby* as powerful as it is.

### [A Simple Swift Value Semantics Reference](reference-guide.md)

This guide aims to inform people on the subject of Value Semantics, a core principle of the Swift programming language through a very simple reference guide. It helps readers identify when something is value semantic, and provides information on utilizing the copy on write optimization for value semantic data types.

### [Learning From the Machine](explainer-article.md)

An article on the landmark victories of DeepMind's AlphaStar against The Little One and MaNa, two professional Starcraft II players. It discusses the importance of these victories, the technology behind AlphaStar, and the implications of these technologies for both eSports athletes, and the rest of the world.

### [Selecting a Modern Type System](literature-review.md)

A review of existing literature on modern refinement typing systems. I outline the approaches being considered for refining types further than
what is possible with a standard algebraic type system. Additionally, I
recommend a strategy for deciding which refinement typing system best
suits your needs based on the requirements for your project.
