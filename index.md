## A Reflection

Looking back on the last semester, I feel proud of what I acomplished.

I know, it's a clique way to start words of reflcetion. It's almost tacky. It reads like a high schooler writing a required reflection at the end of their first English class. But here it holds a greater importance. I've been proud of my writing before, but never truly proud of my acomplishments at the end of any sort of structured course. Looking back on my work this semester though I can truly say that I do feel a great sense of acomplishment. So why? Why is this *different*? What made what I was able to create over the last four months special?

My first essay, *A Discursive Analysis of Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby* read like the english essays I've been trained to write since the beginning of middle school. The paper was ultimately a product of a strong focus on close reading and deep textual analysis. Again, this is not dissimilar from the thousands of English essays I've been forced to write. Yet when writing about the way Why uniquely caputres the essence of my, and so many other's love for Computer Science, I never felt like I was writing the tortured high school essay that had been beaten into my conscience for years on end. I was creating something new, something I cared about. I was rebroadcasting the love and compassion for the subject that Why displays in my own piece of writing.

In my next work of the semester, *A Simple Swift Value Semantics Reference*, I was writing a programming tutorial. I've written programming related documentation before, but this wasn't just documentation. We were tasked with identifying a gap in knowledge, finding a clear need for information, and filling that gap. I knew from past experience how many people failed to grasp the subtle distinction between value types, and value semantics and I wanted to create something to fill that very real need. I wasn't completing an assignment, I was solving a real problem that I cared deeply about.

My next work was *Learning From the Machine**, an artitcle about the stunning victory of DeepMind's AlphaStar against human professional Starcraft II players. This again could have ended up like any research paper, but instead became a carefully crafted story. A story of triumph for humans both through their machines, and through what humans could in turn learn from the machines they created. It became a story that I was deeply invested in due to my personal interest in both machine learning and the ways it can help us learn rather than learn for us.

Finally, I finished off the semester with the literature review *Selecting a Modern Type System*. I've been tasked with writing literature reviews before, but I've always found the task laborious, tedious, and anything but rewarding. This time however I was tasked not just with writing a review of existing knowledge, but with presenting my own interpretation of that knowledge. I got to take a deep dive into a subject I already cared about and truly become an expert in that particular subdomain. Trying to learn enough to have a well crafted opinion on the deeply technical subject I was tasked with wrangling became an obsession. I wanted to learn every last bit that I could about refinement type systems so that I could have a truly educated opinion on the matter. That creation of that report truly was fueled by passion.

So what did make these document special then? Why was I able to look back on them and feel *truly* acomplished? Writing has always been something that I enjoy very conditionally. When writing, if the subject matter means something to me, I'm able to create. Words fly out of my head and onto the page not because I coax them, but because I can't help but contain my own excitement. I want to capture my thoughts *because I care.* When I find myself in such a state while writing, I know even before I'm finished that those are the works which I will be most proud of. Every word I wrote this semester was driven by that passion. I was able to delve into subject matter that I cared about which drove me to create works that I cared about in turn. That is what drove me through the creation of this portfolio, and is also what allows me to look back and say that I'm proud. 

## List of Works

### [A Discursive Analysis of Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](discursive-analysis.md)

Many programming tutorials exist on the internet today, but *Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby* stands out as unique among them. It woos its readers not with a promise of practical knowledge, but with the beauty that Why The Lucky Stiff (the famous ruby programmer) himself sees in programming, and Ruby. I take a look into what makes *Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby* as powerful as it is.

### [A Simple Swift Value Semantics Reference](reference-guide.md)

This guide aims to inform people on the subject of Value Semantics, a core principle of the Swift programming language through a very simple reference guide. It helps readers identify when something is value semantic, and provides information on utilizing the copy on write optimization for value semantic data types.

### [Learning From the Machine](explainer-article.md)

An article on the landmark victories of DeepMind's AlphaStar against The Little One and MaNa, two professional Starcraft II players. It discusses the importance of these victories, the technology behind AlphaStar, and the implications of these technologies for both eSports athletes, and the rest of the world.

### [Selecting a Modern Type System](literature-review.md)

A review of existing literature on modern refinement typing systems. I outline the approaches being considered for refining types further than
what is possible with a standard algebraic type system. Additionally, I
recommend a strategy for deciding which refinement typing system best
suits your needs based on the requirements for your project.
